# A for loop is used to iterate through a sequence like list, tuple, or string [iterables]

for i in range(4):
    print(i)

# example
l = [False,9.22,"Shaq"]
for item in l:

# The range() function in python is used to generate a sequence of number.

# We can also specify the start, stop and step-size as follows:
for i in range(0,21,2): # here 0=start, 21=stop, and 2=step-aside
    print(i)

# range() example
for i in range(0,7):
    print(i)
