# statements like if,if else, elif are called conditional operators
# Sometimes we want to play PUBG on our phone if the day is Sunday.
# Sometimes we order Ice Cream online if the day is sunny.
# Sometimes we go hiking if our parents allow.
# All these are decisions which depend on a condition being met.
# In python programming too, we must be able to execute instructions on a condition(s) being met





a = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if(a==18):
    print("You're eligible") #indentation is the space before print statement

print("None")

# simple if statement will only check if the statement is true

# to check for many values and comparison we use if-else statement
